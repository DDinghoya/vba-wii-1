goombasav.c is designed to edit the compressed SRAM data of the Goomba and Goomba Color emulators. It can extract and replace the compressed Game Boy / Game Boy Color SRAM data. It can't edit savestate data or add new SRAM (yet).

goombarom.c can find uncompressed Game Boy ROMs within larger files (e.g. a Goomba Color .gba ROM, or a .tar archive.) It was written for my fork of TGB Dual.
